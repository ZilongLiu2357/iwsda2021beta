	<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; In this talk, we discuss the problem of Byzantines in the context of Distributed Inference Networks. 
	Distributed inference networks have many applications including military surveillance, cognitive radio networks and smart grid. 
	A distributed inference network typically consists of local sensors sending information to a central processing unit 
	(known as the Fusion Center) that is responsible for inference. The network may contain malicious sensors that may engage 
	in data falsification which can result in a wrong inference at the Fusion Center. Drawing parallel to the "Byzantine Generals Problem", 
	the local sensors are the generals who try to make a decision in the presence of traitors called "Byzantines". 
	We present an overview of recent research on this problem. Discussion includes the susceptibility of distributed 
	inference networks to Byzantines, and then the possible protection of these networks through mitigation of Byzantines. 
	This problem setup lends itself to a game theoretic formulation. 
	The game between the network and Byzantines is discussed and solutions presented. 
	Some avenues for further research in this area are provided. </p>

	<h3> 17:00-18:00, Monday, Oct 21, 2019</h3>

	<h3>Tor Helleseth</h3>

	<p><strong>Professor Emeritus, Department of Informatics,<em> University of Bergen.</em></strong></p>

    
	
	<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; 
Sequences with low correlation have been a topic for intensive research for many decades. 
In this talk we will describe the correlation properties of sequences and sequence families with low correlation, 
in particular constructions that are based upon m-sequences. The talk will survey several constructions of classical families. 
The talk will also pay a tribute to Solomon Golomb, the great icon in the field of sequences, 
who passed away in 2016 after receiving the Franklin Medal and many other prestigious awards for his lifelong work using mathematics 
for the constructions and applications of sequences in communications. Furthermore, this talk describes some families of sequences with 
good correlation properties that are constructed over the binary as well as over the alphabet Z4={0,1,2,3} including Gold, Kasami, 
Kerdock sequences, Family A and related sequences. 
In particular we show the history and background for the construction of a family of Z4 sequences 
used in the 3G standard for mobile communications.

	<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; Linear codes have diverse applications in secret sharing schemes, authentication codes, communication data storage devices, consumer electronics, 
	association schemes, strongly regular graphs and secure two-party computation. In this talk, we focus on linear codes from cryptographic functions and polynomials over finite fields.
We shall discuss two particular classes of linear codes: minimal linear codes (which have significant applications in secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation) 
and locally recoverable codes (which currently form one of the rapidly developing topics in coding theory because of their applications in distributed and cloud storage systems).
